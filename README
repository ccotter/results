LU decomposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LU decomposition using discontiguous blocks (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128).
We run on matrices of sizes NxN where N takes on values in {16, 32, 64, 128, 256
512, 1024, 2048}. When the matrix is too small for the partition size, we don't
partition (i.e. use a partition block equal in size to the matrix itself).

* Matrix mutlitplication of two 1024x1024 matrices. The matrices are partitioned
  into blocks of size 256x256. The main thread forks 16 tasks to compute each
  partitioned block. There is no synchronization/locking, so all threads are
  started immediately, and the main thread joins on each.

* md5 hash string searcher (e.g. to crack passwords).

* quicksort.
